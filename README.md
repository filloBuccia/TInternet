# TInternet
Terminal - Internet is a easy to use and user friendly terminal tool that allows you to do internet speed tests with a single command

TInternet wasn't born for becoming a complete and competitive tool and it doesn't want to become. The only purpose of the creator is to pubblic an open source tool that may help or could give a project idea to someone. 

All the contributes and requests are appreciated
